# Blockchain-Based Decentralized Marketplace

A Python-based blockchain project that facilitates a decentralized marketplace using peer-to-peer networking, blockchain technology, and a RESTful Flask API. This project enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions for listing and purchasing products in a distributed environment.

## üåü Features

- **Blockchain Technology**: Implements Proof of Work (PoW) for block validation.
- **Decentralized Network**: Nodes communicate via a P2P network for syncing blockchain and transactions.
- **User-Friendly Marketplace**: Interfaces for listing products, buying items, and managing inventory.
- **Data Persistence**: Each node maintains its blockchain and transactions using SQLite databases.
- **RESTful API**: Offers endpoints to interact with the blockchain and manage transactions.

---

## üõ† Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Networking**: Peer-to-Peer (p2pnetwork library)

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Flask
- SQLite
- Requests library
- p2pnetwork library

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hasan-Hamzaa/Test.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   Start a blockchain node using:
   ```bash
   python node.py --port <PORT>
   ```
   Replace `<PORT>` with the port number for your node. For example:
   ```bash
   python node.py --port 5001
   python node.py --port 5002
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:<FLASK_PORT>
   ```
   Replace `<FLASK_PORT>` with the corresponding Flask port (e.g., 8000 for port 5001), I did this forward to solve the conflicts.

## üí° Usage

### Web Interface
- **Sell Products**: Navigate to `/sell` to list a product for sale.
- **Buy Products**: Navigate to `/buy` to view and purchase available items.
- **View Transactions and Blocks**: Visit `/view_database` to inspect blockchain and transaction history.
- **Monitor Network Activity**: View connected peers and activity at `/network_activity`.

### Blockchain Operations
- **Mine a Block**: Trigger mining with the `/mine_block` endpoint.
- **Check Blockchain Validity**: Use the `/is_valid` endpoint to verify data integrity.
